#+title: Natural Selection


*Theory proposed by Charles Darwin.*

It serves as a means of filtering on nature. Nature /filters out/ the
inidividuals that are less suited to their environment.

In [[id:ba9c3dd2-1038-4ac8-ae68-45bf780eefa5][Biology]], these adaptations are refered to as /mutations/, for a change to be
mutation, it has to be present on some individuals while abscent on others. If
the mutation is positive to the individual, it will allow it for a better life,
which will let such individual to pass this mutation to its offspring.

* Cognition
One question arises: can we use a theory such as natural selection and evolution
to determine the evolutional path of human cognition?.
So far, the fisiology of the brain only tells a little part of the story; and
acquired capabilities, such as math leave no trace on a fossil.
