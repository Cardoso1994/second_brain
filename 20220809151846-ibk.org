+ Family of [[id:2918962a-9108-4527-a30e-d550d0e994c6][classification]] algorithms based on the [[id:eb8710f0-c7b8-4a6b-8a94-9c5d4040dfea][kNN]] family; are considered an improvement
  over the original kNN algorithms.
+ the $$k$$ parameter holds the same meaning than in the kNN family, i.e., $$k$$
  is the number of nearest neighbors taken into account for the classification
+ capable of working with mixed values, i.e., patterns containing categorical
  and numerical attributes; it can also handle missing values.
+ Instead of using a [[id:7a0d38b0-72b6-4866-bced-4d3937baf55d][Minkowski Metrics]], it uses the HEOM metric, which is
  computed as follows:
  #+name: heom_prev
  [[./img/heom.png][heom_metric]]
after computing $$d_a(x_a, y_a)$$, according to the figure above, whe obtain the
HEOM metric value with the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
HEOM(x, y) = \left( \sum_{a=1}^{m} d_a(x_a, y_a)^2  \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation*}

+ for the case where there are only numerical attributes and no missing values,
  we see that the HEOM computes a /normalized/ euclidean distance.
