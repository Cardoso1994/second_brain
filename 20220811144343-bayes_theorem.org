#+title: Bayes Theorem
#+filetags: draft

It helps us answer questions of the type: "what is the probability that certain
event /A/ happens, given that we know /B/ has happened? ", in probability terms
we express this as:  $$P(A \vert B)$$, and is computed with the following
equation:
\begin{equation*}
P\left( B_k \vert A \right) =
        \frac{P(B_{k}) P(A | B_{k})}{\sum_{i = 1}^{k} P(B_{i})P(A | B_{i})}
\end{equation*}
where:
+ $$A$$ is an event that has already happened
+ $$B_k$$ is the event we want to know if will happen or not
+ $$B = \{B_1, B_2, \dots, B_k\}$$ are all the events that could happen from
  experiment $$B$$.
