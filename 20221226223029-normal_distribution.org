name of /Gaussian/ distribution.

Its shape is that of a bell, so it can only be refered to as /Gaussian bell/.

+ It is always *centered around the mean* value of the distribution.
+ The width of the bell is defined by the *standard deviation* of the
  distribution.
+ Tipycally, in a normal distribution, 95% of the samples fall in the range of
  the mean +/- two stds.
