#+title: population and estimated parameters

In [[id:1b63d5d6-2956-436d-8e0e-9374ad160f44][Statistics]] and [[id:1ea3fed6-1ad4-42ae-970a-e2306f9b2396][Probability]], when we fit a curve to a [[id:8b1600f8-ecaf-4c98-9d60-d18e3fd83953][Histogram]], for example,
via a Gaussian Bell Curve, otherwise known as [[id:9db9e335-c01f-4ac5-8c93-d88d7d5d3d7b][Normal Distribution]], such curve is
said to /fit the population/. This curve fits the whole population of the
phenomenon we are studying; generally, we do not have the resources (time or
money) to sample data from the whole population, so most of the times we sample
a few datapoints and, based on them we /estimate/ the population values.

Examples of population values are: population [[id:266184a6-f699-4dd1-9390-08f0fa52f5b1][mean]] and population
[[id:ebcc3101-af2b-40a3-a520-7d7937950e2f][standard deviation]] and [[id:6dad2484-02b8-4e96-a896-e0f95076667c][variance]], while the estimated counterparts are the
/estimated [[id:266184a6-f699-4dd1-9390-08f0fa52f5b1][mean]]/, /estimated [[id:ebcc3101-af2b-40a3-a520-7d7937950e2f][standard deviation]]/ and /estimated [[id:6dad2484-02b8-4e96-a896-e0f95076667c][variance]]/.

The reason behind estimating population values is to get /reproducible/ results,
i.e., the results obtained in an experiment with estimated parameters can be
obtained in a different experiment for the same phenomenon. Normally, the
estimated values will differ both from experiment to experiment and from the
original population values, which is why one need to compute [[id:3156856d-8849-486f-b5da-6d4cca9a0fa6][p-values]] or
[[id:b17f7810-c556-4391-b953-01a8e37ea6f3][confidence intervals]], *to see how confident we can be of our sampled data and
the results computed from it*.

Generally speaking, *the more data, the more confidence we can have in the
computed results*

This can be seen as an analogous procedure to [[id:c8fd948c-556b-4f7c-aa80-c5f83904a39a][Machine Learning]], where the sample
data with wich we are going to estimate values is *the training data*, while the
population curve is the *function we are trying to aproximate* and, lastly, the
estimated parameters as well as other results based on those, are the
predictions carried on by the model.
