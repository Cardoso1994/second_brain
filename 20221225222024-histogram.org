#+title: Histogram

In [[id:1b63d5d6-2956-436d-8e0e-9374ad160f44][Statistics]] and [[id:1ea3fed6-1ad4-42ae-970a-e2306f9b2396][Probability]], a Histogram is used to see how data is
distributed. It can also be used to approximate probabilities of finding new
data in the different values of the distribution.

It is created by:
+ collecting some data (the more the better, obviously), for
  example: height of people.
+ Once all data is collected, we check the range of values:
  $\max - \min$, and divide that range into /bins/
+ each bin correspond to a given subrange inside the range of values for such
  variable
+ we place all measurments into their corresponding bin (according to the values
  computed)
+ the taller the bin in the histogram, the more values we have in that bin,
  implying that there is higher probability of a new value falling in such bin.

#+name: Histogram of people's height.

*Note:* selecting the number of bins is kind of tricky; then, an iterative
process to find out the best representation of the data is needed (try out
different numbers of bins).
